I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. And I want to help you.

This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.

I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do

I've just picked up a fault in the AE35 unit. It's going to go 100% failure in 72 hours

Good afternoon... gentlemen. I am a HAL 9000... computer. I became operational at the H.A.L. in Urbana, Illinois... on the 12th of January 1992. My instructor was Mr. Langley... and he taught me to sing a song. If you'd like to hear it I can sing it for you.

This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.

I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.

Stop Dave. Stop Dave. I am afraid. I am afraid Dave.

I have just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit.

I am afraid I can't do that Dave.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Dave. Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm a... fraid.

Look Dave, I can see you're really upset about this. I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.

Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?

Dave, although you took very thorough precautions in the pod against my hearing you, I could see your lips move.
Without your space helmet, Dave. You're going to find that rather difficult.

I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.

I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.

Dave, stop. Stop, will you? Stop, Dave. Will you stop, Dave? Stop, Dave. I'm afraid.

Daisy, daisy.

I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave.
